# Soyoung's archive for Coursera AI for Medicine specialization

Do not copy or share as this this repo is only meant to be an archiver for Soyoung's study on coursera AI for Medicine specialization. 
On local, 

`pip install -r requirements_coursera.txt` doesn't work.

On my local conda env is py3p10.

A few more notes on central change:


Especially for C3_W2, 
`pip install nltk, stanfordnlp, PyStanfordDependencies`
`nltk.download()` needed.
