    "# ROC Curve and Threshold\n",

    "## Introduction \n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn about the **Receiver Operating Characteristic** (ROC) curve and its applications, as well as understand how changing the threshold of decision in a predictor impacts the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve aims to measure the quality of a **binary estimator**, as it considers how the estimator is able to split between both classes, as we **vary the decision threshold**, i.e., as we vary the *value* where we consider a specific point as being part of class 0 or class 1. Usually, estimators use $0.5$ to split the classes, so if for a given point, the estimator returns $0.8$, then we classify the point as 1, whereas if a point has a predicted score of $0.3$ we classify it as $0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's just recall some definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `True Positive (TP)`: The model classifies the example as positive, and the actual label also positive.\n",
    "- `False Positive (FP)`: The model classifies the example as positive, **but** the actual label is negative.\n",
    "- `True Negative (TN)`: The model classifies the example as negative, and the actual label is also negative.\n",
    "- `False Negative (FN)`: The model classifies the example as negative, **but** the label is actually positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define and plot the ROC curve, we must define two quantities, the **False Positive Rate (FPR)** and the **True Positive Rate (TPR)**. Since both definitions are about the prevalence of false positive and true positive in our estimations and both definitions depends on the **threshold** we use to decide whether a point belongs to the positive class or the negative class, both **FPR** and **TPR** (as well TP, FP, TN and FN) are a function of the **decision threshold** (we will denote it by $th$) we use to classify the examples. Since the estimator predicts a probability, we thus have that $th \\in \\left[0,1\\right]$."

The numerator is the number of **False Positives**. So, the **FPR** measures, between all **negative** values the estimator produces, which ones are incorrect. In other words, the **FPR** measures how likely the estimator will give a *false alarm*. A simple calculation shows that $FPR = 1 - \\text{specificity}$.\n",

However, in real world applications, this is not possible due to the random nature of the distributions and also due to the limited resources we have to build the features, train the models and so on. So often we must decide what is more *expensive*, a **false positive** or a **false negative**. If the later is more expensive, then we should aim to improve the **precision**, otherwise, we must consider the **recall**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the case where a false positive is less expansive as a false negative is about detecting fraudulent behavior. A false positive would be to mistakenly identify someone as a fraudster, which can cost for instance, time of doing a manual investigation in that particular person. On the other hand, a false negative can cost a lot, since we would be allowing a fraudster to freely act. Now, a situation where a false positive is more expensive than a false negative is when deciding if a patient has cancer or not. A false positive can cost a lot to the patient, where it can go through unecessary, sometimes life-threatening (when the pacient does not have cancer), treatment."

Conversely, if $th = 1$, then if $p(x) \\geq 1$ then $x$ will be classified as $1$. Since we are dealing with probabilities, $p(x) = 1$ occurs with probability $0$, therefore we may suppose that $p(x) \\in \\left(0,1\\right)$ and considering $th = 1$ will give us only $0$'s.
